## Overview

Big news... I created my own personal [wedding website üòç](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/)! Here it is below, in all its glory:

![Website - Home Page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtgeenuny/image/upload/v1700954580/Wedding%20Website.png)

It comes equipped with the following pages:
- [Home](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/)
- [Wedding Weekend](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/wedding-weekend) (weekend itinerary)
- [TBD and Luc](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/tbd-and-luc) (the story of how my non-existent wife and I met)
- [FAQs](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/faqs)
- [Travel](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/travel) (travel guidance)
- [Accomodations](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/accomodations)
- [RSVP](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/rsvp)

### The RSVP Page üíå

The [RSVP page](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/rsvp), in particular, is where most of the magic happens ‚ú®. You can search for an RSVP for any of the following guests below:

<div>
    <div className="flex flex-col md:grid md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-x-3">
        <div className="flex md:col-span-1">
            | First Name | Last Name |
            | ---- | ---- |
            | John | Doe |
            | Jane | Smith |
            | Barack | Obama |
            | Chuck | Norris |
            | Luc | Marrie |
        </div>
        <div className="col-span-2">

### Project Goals

Initially when I started this project, I wanted to continue exploring [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (a [React](https://react.dev/)-based framework for building UIs) and to get my hands dirty with some kind of [database](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/)... even if for a very lightweight use case.

To date, all websites I had built thus far:

1. Were fully **static** in nature (page content is already set in stone)
2. Or, when **dynamic** data is requied, relied on simple `GET` calls to previously-existing APIs

As such, I wanted to pick a simple website use case that would require me to create my own database.

### So... Why a Wedding Website?

You may have noticed the title of my website is "TBD and Luc". That's because I'm not actually getting married... (nor do I have a gf/fianc√©e lol).

I'm still a single man, traversing life's winding roads in solitude. However, I fret not because surely my unwavering pursuit of web dev knowledge will lead me to true love.

Anyway, prior to the üçÇ fall of 2023, I had yet to attend my first wedding. When it rains, it pours I guess... because suddenly three back-to-back weddings popped up on my calendar üò®.

In terms of the wedding sites, they were created by the following service providers:
1. [Zola](https://www.zola.com/)
2. [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/)
3. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)

Given that I literally help companies make websites for a living, it was interesting to examines websites for a totally different use case from my line of work... and to inspect the visual layout and feature differences between each provider.

In terms of similarities, features included:
- Several pages of **static** content (FAQs, photos, "how we met", etc.)
- Usually a **registry**
- In all cases, an **RSVP** page (where a user provides some sort of unique identifier, granting them read/write access to their RSVP info)

In any case, based on the described functionality, I decided a wedding website was a perfect use case for my project.

## Website Development

Alright, now for the meat and potatoes ü•© ü•î... how was this thing made?

### Features

For an [MVP](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product/), I decided to prioritize the following features:

| Feature | Description | MVP |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `Static Pages` | Pages with static content (e.g. home, wedding schedule, FAQs, etc.). | ‚úÖ |
| `RSVP (Read)` | Let's user check on the status of their RSVP using first/last name. | ‚úÖ |
| `RSVP (Write)` | Let's user submit/update their RSVP information. | ‚ùå |
| `Registry` | Registry page for that new Espresso machine I've had my eyes on. Doing this from scratch would require me to either build an e-commerce site essentially... so, I'm gonna pass for now. If I were to seriously pursue this, I'd probably use a URL 200 rewrite (or `iframe`) to a page hosted on Zola/The Knot.  | ‚ùå |
| `Site Password Protection` | Secure site with basic password protection. I will revisit this in the near future. | ‚ùå |

### Architecture

To support the above feature set, I loosely adhered to this tacky architecture diagram:

### Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Front-end)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Hosting + serverless functions)
- [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/storage/postgres) (Backend database for all my lovely guests and their RSVPs)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Styling)

Let's break down each component:


#### Pages

Ixxx

```zsh
app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accomodations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ events.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ faqs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rsvp
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tbd-and-luc
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ travel
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wedding-weekend
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon.ico
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
```

#### Serverless Function

When a user clicks "RSVP", I need my app to be able to execute custom logic against my DB in a secure way. Hence... the need for a serverless function.

[Vercel's serverless function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) feature set made this pretty straightforward.

```zsh
app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ find-invitation
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route.ts
```
