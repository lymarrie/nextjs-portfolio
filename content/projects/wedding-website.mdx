## Overview

Big news... I created my own personal [wedding website üòç](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/)! Here it is below, in all its glory:

![Website - Home Page](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtgeenuny/image/upload/v1700954580/Wedding%20Website.png)

It comes equipped with the following pages:
- [Home](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/)
- [Wedding Weekend](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/wedding-weekend) (weekend itinerary)
- [TBD and Luc](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/tbd-and-luc) (the story of how my non-existent wife and I met)
- [FAQs](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/faqs)
- [Travel](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/travel) (travel guidance)
- [Accomodations](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/accomodations)
- [RSVP](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/rsvp)

### The RSVP Page üíå

The [RSVP page](https://wedding-website-lymarrie.vercel.app/rsvp), in particular, is where most of the magic happens ‚ú®. You can search for an RSVP for any of the following guests below:

<div>
    <div className="flex flex-col md:grid md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-x-3">
        <div className="flex md:col-span-1">
            | First Name | Last Name |
            | ---- | ---- |
            | John | Doe |
            | Jane | Smith |
            | Barack | Obama |
            | Chuck | Norris |
            | Luc | Marrie |
        </div>
        <div className="col-span-2">

### Project Goals

Initially when I started this project, I wanted to continue exploring [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (a [React](https://react.dev/)-based framework for building UIs) and to get my hands dirty with some kind of [database](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/)... even if for a very lightweight use case.

To date, all websites I had built thus far:

1. Were fully **static** in nature (page content is already set in stone)
2. Or, when **dynamic** data is requied, relied on simple `GET` calls to previously-existing APIs

As such, I wanted to pick a simple website use case that would require me to create my own database.

### So... Why a Wedding Website?

You may have noticed the title of my website is "TBD and Luc". That's because I'm not actually getting married... (nor do I have a gf/fianc√©e lol).

I'm still a single man, traversing life's winding roads in solitude. However, I fret not because surely my unwavering pursuit of web dev knowledge will lead me to true love.

Anyway, prior to the üçÇ fall of 2023, I had yet to attend my first wedding. When it rains, it pours I guess... because suddenly three back-to-back weddings popped up on my calendar üò®.

In terms of the wedding sites, they were created by the following service providers:
1. [Zola](https://www.zola.com/)
2. [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/)
3. [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)

Given that I literally help companies make websites for a living, it was interesting to examines websites for a totally different use case from my line of work... and to inspect the visual layout and feature differences between each provider.

In terms of similarities, features included:
- Several pages of **static** content (FAQs, photos, "how we met", etc.)
- Usually a **registry**
- In all cases, an **RSVP** page (where a user provides some sort of unique identifier, granting them read/write access to their RSVP info)

In any case, based on the described functionality, I decided a wedding website was a perfect use case for my project.

## Website Development

Alright, now for the meat and potatoes ü•© ü•î... how was this thing made?

### Features

For an [MVP](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/minimum-viable-product/), I decided to prioritize the following features:

| Feature | Description | MVP |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| Static Pages | Pages with static content (e.g. home, wedding schedule, FAQs, etc.). | ‚úÖ |
| RSVP (Read) | Let's user check on the status of their RSVP using first/last name. | ‚úÖ |
| RSVP (Write) | Let's user submit/update their RSVP information. | ‚ùå |
| Registry | Registry page for that new Espresso machine I've had my eyes on. Doing this from scratch would require me to either build an e-commerce site essentially... so, I'm gonna pass for now. If I were to seriously pursue this, I'd probably use a URL 200 rewrite (or `iframe`) to a page hosted on Zola/The Knot.  | ‚ùå |
| Site Password Protection | Secure site with basic password protection. I will revisit this in the near future. | ‚ùå |

### Architecture

To support the above feature set, I loosely adhered to this tacky architecture diagram:

### Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Front-end)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Hosting + serverless functions)
- [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/storage/postgres) (Backend database for all my lovely guests and their RSVPs)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Styling)

### Building the Static Pages

To kick things off, I scaffolded my project and created a blank canvas for each page using Next.js's [quickstart flow](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation), which now uses [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) by default (as opposed to [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages)).

```zsh
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Note that because I'm new to Next.js, everything described below is written exclusively with knowledge of app router only.

#### Pages

In Next.js, each folder is used to define a "route" (path at which a page is available in the browser). Creating a `page` file under each route is what makes the UI at that path publicly accessible. As such, I was able to create each page of my site using the directory structure below:

```zsh 
app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accomodations   <-- defines URL
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx    <-- UI defined here is exposed at folder name
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ faqs
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rsvp
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tbd-and-luc
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ travel
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wedding-weekend
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx        <-- automatically shared layout
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx          <-- home page
```

#### Shared Layout

In Next.js projects, `layout` is a special file. As Next.js defines it:

> A layout is UI that is shared between multiple pages. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive, and do not re-render. 

Honestly, it's unclear to me if this is a <em>React</em> feature or a <em>Next.js</em> feature (or both, technically, since Next.js is React cloaked in robot armor). Either way though, it's nice because each page in my app will have the same structure... so there's no need to re-render the layout each time a page loads.

When a layout is defined at the `app/` root, it acts as a ["global" layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required); applying to all routes in my app automatically. 

This was a neat discovery... to celebrate the momentous occasion, I added a header and footer component right away.

```tsx
import Navbar from './components/navbar'
import Footer from './components/footer'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className="">
        <Navbar />
        {children}
        <Footer />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Beyond that, the rest of my initial work was just plain old React development (components, styling, etc.).

### RSVP Page and Database

Next was the RSVP page. Here's how I decided it should work:
1. A guest can enter their first/last name on the page
2. If the guest exists in my database, return their current RSVP information (i.e. which events they're currently RSVPed to)
3. If the guest doesn't exist, return an error 

#### Creating a Database

Back when I was in school, I was the type of student that never used a notebook planner to write down the homework... I'd just memorize it (and that seemed to work 93% of the time).

Unfortunately, because my future wife will probably invite thousands of people to the wedding, there's no way I'll be able to memorize each one (***AND*** the events they're going to) in my head.

Ladies and gentlemen... **enter the database**:

![database gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/pOEbLRT4SwD35IELiQ/giphy.gif)

I had two important questions to answer:
1. What kind of database should I use? (e.g. relational, NoSQL, key-value store, graph... etc.)
2. And from which DB provider? üò®

#### Serverless Function

[Vercel's serverless function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) feature set made this pretty straightforward.

```zsh
app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ find-invitation
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route.ts
```
